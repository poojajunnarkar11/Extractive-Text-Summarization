Malignant transformation can occur through the formation of novel oncogenes, the inappropriate over-expression of normal oncogenes, or by the under-expression or disabling of tumor suppressor genes. In order for a normal cell to transform into a cancer cell, the genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation must be altered. Typically, changes in multiple genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell. More common are mutations, which are changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA. Genetic changes can occur at different levels and by different mechanisms. The gain or loss of an entire chromosome can occur through
